I was awarded the TechAccel Summer Stipend Award by the McGill University Engine Team. The award will allow me to work on the MADS startup over the summer along with other Undergraduate students at McGill University. The goal of the project is to produce Multi-Agent ROS2 Robotics Software that can be used in any delivery system.
